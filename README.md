Click on the link under "About".

## Description

A template repository for a minimal academic website.
It relies only upon [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com) which it loads in each html file.
It is meant to be the bare minimum of html styling that still allows for an academic site that looks good on desktop or mobile.

The website contains:

- Home page
  - profile picture
  - logo png
  - [Bootstrap 5 Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com)
- About page
- Research page
- CV pdf

## How to Use

Click "Use this template".

## Customization

Add your own "profile.jpg", "logo.png", and "cv.pdf" to the repository.
Then simply go through each html file and edit the text however you would like.

The "research.html" page makes use of Bootstrap "cards", which you can read more about [here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/card/).

Change the theme by choosing a new [Bootswatch theme](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/bootswatch/?theme=4) (default is Flatly). Replace the bootswatch CDN link in each html file with the new theme.
